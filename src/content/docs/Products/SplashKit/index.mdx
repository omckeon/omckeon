## SplashKit Overview

As a new contributor to SplashKit, you’ll be working on a versatile and beginner-friendly software
development toolkit focused on simplifying 2D game development and interactive applications.
SplashKit already supports cross-platform development for Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing
developers to use a single codebase for multiple platforms.

This document aims to provide a brief overview of the SplashKit ecosystem and highlight the core
areas where you’ll contribute to SplashKit’s growth. The focus of future growth will be on extending
its functionality, improving existing features, and supporting the developer community through
improved tutorials and documentation.

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Internal-facing website for Thoth-Tech team members.
- Main Responsibility: Internal guides, feature explanations, and team-focused documentation.
- Target Audience: Thoth-Tech team members.

</Aside>

The Thoth-Tech Documentation Website is an internal platform focused on providing detailed
explanations of features and guides targeted at the Thoth-Tech team. It serves as a valuable
resource for team members to reference when contributing to SplashKit or collaborating on projects.
Contributors may need to update or write internal-facing documentation, particularly as new features
or internal tools are developed.

#### Documentation

</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Miscellaneous documentation for research, uncompleted work, or non-public reports.
- Main Responsibility: Contributing to documents that do not fit within the other repositories.
- Target Audience: Internal team members needing access to research reports, development notes, and
  incomplete work.

</Aside>

The documentation repository is a 'miscellaneous' collection where all documents that do not fit
into other repositories are stored. This might include research reports, documentation on incomplete
or experimental features, or other internal records. Contributors might add new documentation here
or help organize and maintain existing records to ensure they are accessible and up-to-date.

### SplashKit Development

#### SplashKit Core

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Repository" href="https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-core" />
  <LinkCard
    title="Contributing"
    href="https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md"
  />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Contribute to the foundation of the SDK
- Primarily built in C++ and is translated into C#, Python and Pascal
- Main Responsibilities: Adding new features and fixing bugs.
- Cross-Platform: Windows, MacOS and Linux.

</Aside>

Contributing to SplashKit Core means working directly on the foundation of the SDK. This involves
core functionalities like rendering, audio management, input handling, and more. As a team member,
you’ll focus on adding new features, fixing bugs, and ensuring the overall performance of the SDK
remains high.

While the core is primarily built in C++, you’ll be contributing to a codebase that supports
translation into other languages like C#, Python, and Pascal. Although the translation process is
largely automated, maintaining the quality and performance of the core features will be your main
responsibility. Cross-platform development is central to SplashKit, so you'll be handling different
OS nuances as you work on features that need to run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### SplashKit Manager (SKM)

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Repository" href="https://github.com/thoth-tech/skm" />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- CLI tool for project setup, dependency management and compilation.
- Main Responsibiltiies: Ensuring alignment with SplashKit-Core updates and new features.
- Focus is on integration of dependencies and improving developer workflows.

</Aside>

The SplashKit Manager (SKM) is a command-line interface (CLI) and application tool designed to
simplify the development workflow with SplashKit. It automates tasks such as project setup,
dependency management, compilation, and running code across different platforms. Contributions to
SKM will primary be to ensure it stays aligned with updates and new features in SplashKit Core. For
example, you’ll ensure that new dependencies or libraries introduced in the core SDK are correctly
included and managed across all supported platforms.

Beyond core synchronisation, there may also be opportunities to improve the overall user experience
by streamlining project initialization, refining dependency management, or adding tools that make
the workflow more efficient for developers. However, your primary focus will be ensuring SKM
seamlessly integrates with the evolving features and requirements of the core SplashKit SDK.

#### SplashKit Translator

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Repository" href="https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-translator" />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Translates SplashKits' C++ core functionality into C#, Python and Pascal bindings.
- Written in Ruby and uses the ERB templating system.
- Minimal direct contributions needed, focus remains on core SDK improvements which propagate
  through translation.

</Aside>

The SplashKit Translator automates the process of translating SplashKit’s core C++ functionality
into other supported languages like C#, Python, and Pascal. Since this process is largely automated
using ERB templating, there’s minimal need for direct contributions here.

Your focus will remain on maintaining and enhancing the core SDK, as changes there will naturally
propagate through the automated translation process. Ensuring that core features are implemented
cleanly and efficiently in C++ will help maintain consistency across languages.

#### SplashKit Online

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Repository" href="https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashkitOnline" />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Web-Based IDE for using SplashKit in the browser.
- Currently supports Javascript and (experimental) C++ - Main responsiibilities may include
  integrating full language support.
- Focus on improving the user experience, performance and language-specific features.

</Aside>

SplashKit Online is a web-based IDE designed to help beginner programmers quickly start building 2D
games directly in the browser. While it currently supports JavaScript (with experimental C++
functionality) and leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to execute SplashKit code, the goal is to expand
this support to include all languages that SplashKit supports: C#, Python, and Pascal.

As a contributor to SplashKit Online, your primary responsibility will be developing and integrating
full support for these languages, allowing users to write and run code in C#, Python, and Pascal
seamlessly within the browser-based environment. This will involve extending the IDE's functionality
to handle language-specific nuances and ensuring that WebAssembly can execute code from these
languages efficiently.

Your work will also include improving the user experience, making the platform more intuitive and
accessible for users, and ensuring that the transition between languages is smooth. This could
involve building better language selection interfaces, optimizing performance for different
languages, and adding language-specific tools or debugging features.

#### Arcade Machines

</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- SplashKit-powered arcade machines located on Deakin campuses.
- Uses emulationstation, retropie, and a custom application for game execution.
- Allows students to upload and test games on real arcade hardware.

</Aside>

The Arcade Machines on Deakin Campuses use emulationstation, retropie, and a custom SplashKit
application to run games built using the SplashKit SDK. These machines offer students the
opportunity to upload their games and test them in a real-world arcade environment. The machines are
designed to help students see their creations in action on physical hardware, making for a hands-on
experience that bridges the gap between development and arcade-style game deployment.

#### Game Development

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Focused team developing games to showcase SplashKit’s capabilities.
- Adheres to industry-standard game design patterns and practices.
- Aims to demonstrate the full potential of SplashKit in game development.

</Aside>

The Game Development team is a small, focused group that produces games designed to highlight the
capabilities of SplashKit. These games follow industry-standard design patterns and practices to
ensure they are polished and well-structured. The goal is to showcase what can be achieved using
SplashKit while maintaining professional standards in game design and development. These projects
serve as both a demonstration of SplashKit’s features and an inspiration for developers using the
SDK to build their own games.
