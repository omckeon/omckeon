Documentation plays a vital role in the software development lifecycle at Thoth Tech. It ensures
that our sustainable solutions are well-understood, accessible, and can be effectively handed over
or referenced in the future. Proper documentation helps others understand the workings and rationale
behind projects, facilitating continuity and knowledge sharing.

Documentation provides official information, prepared by the company, for both users and
contributors. It is tailored to specific audiences and offers insights into the development
lifecycle and final product.

All Thoth Tech documentation is stored in the
[Documentation Repository](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation) on our company GitHub.
Documentation should be written in Markdown and cover various aspects such as research, meeting
minutes, and software user guides.
