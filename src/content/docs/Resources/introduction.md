## Storage of Documentation

Proper documentation is a crucial aspect of company operations at Thoth Tech. This includes:

- Research findings
- Meeting notes
- Testing processes and results
- And more

All documentation must adhere to the
[Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/documentation/writing-style-guide.md)
and be stored in designated locations. The following sections describe the appropriate places for
storing different types of documentation and recommended practices.

### Documentation Website

The Documentation Website serves as the "source of truth" for Thoth Tech, providing high-level
information about the company, its projects, products, and teams. It includes:

- **Product Information:**
  - Overview, goals, and objectives
  - Onboarding guides for new members
- **Team Information:**
  - Team members and their roles
  - Trimester objectives and goals
- **Company-Wide Information:**
  - Communication and contribution guidelines
  - Best practice policies and learning resources (e.g., Markdown usage)
  - Onboarding and offboarding processes
  - Company reports, charter, and structure
  - Leadership information, data strategies, and quality assurance practices

### Documentation Repository

The [Documentation Repository](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation) houses documents that do
not fit into the Company Handbook but are important for transparency and tracking team progress.
Each team has a dedicated folder within the repository for storing:

- Research notes and findings
- Planning documents
- Diagrams
- Meeting notes
- Collaborative documents
- Testing processes and results

This centralised repository helps document the work of individuals and teams.

### Microsoft Teams Channels

Microsoft Teams channels are essential for effective communication and collaboration within Thoth
Tech. They provide a centralised space for team discussions, real-time messaging, and document
sharing, which are critical for maintaining coordination and engagement among team members.

Channels are primarily used for:

- **Communication:** Engage in discussions, share updates, and provide feedback in a structured
  manner. Channels facilitate clear and organised conversations among team members, ensuring that
  information is easily accessible and traceable.
- **Collaboration:** Collaborate on projects and tasks through integrated tools and shared files.
  Channels support collaborative document editing and real-time interaction, enabling teams to work
  together efficiently.

- **Meeting Coordination:** Schedule and conduct team meetings directly within channels. This
  practice helps in keeping all relevant information and discussions in one place, making it easier
  to track and reference meeting outcomes.

While Microsoft Teams channels are not intended for storing finalised work or extensive
documentation, they play a crucial role in supporting ongoing communication and collaborative
efforts. For such documents, refer to the Documentation Repository or the Documentation Website.

#### File & Folder Naming Conventions

For any documents or notes shared in Microsoft Teams channels, use the following naming convention
for folders: **Trimester-Year-TeamName** (e.g., "T2-2022-CompanyLeadership"). File names should be
descriptive and concise to aid in quick identification and retrieval (e.g., "Team-Meeting-Notes"
rather than "Untitled1"). This practice helps maintain organisation and ensures that all members can
easily locate relevant files.

## Conducting Team Meetings

Regular team meetings, held at least weekly, are essential for team engagement, collaboration, and
management. These meetings are opportunities to discuss team direction, tasks, and member progress.

Try to record all impromptu meetings so that they can be referred to at a later date, as well as be
used as evidence towards your portfolio.

### Location of Team Meetings

Each Thoth Tech team is assigned a private channel in Microsoft Teams for communication and
collaboration. **Team meetings should be conducted in these private channels** to maintain
consistency and transparency. This practice also enables company directors to monitor team
engagement and attend meetings when necessary.

#### Scheduling Meetings in Private Channels

To schedule a recurring meeting in a private Microsoft Teams channel:

1. In Microsoft Teams, click the three dots next to the relevant team channel's name.
2. Select "Get email address" from the drop-down menu.
3. Copy the channel's email address (found in angle brackets) from the resulting window.
4. Go to the "Calendar" section in Teams and click "New meeting."
5. Paste the channel email address into the "Add required attendees" field.
6. Complete the meeting details (name, date, recurrence, description) and save.

This setup will send a meeting invite to all channel members and add the event to the calendar.

### Meeting Recordings

Recording meetings is crucial for documenting engagement and collaboration. Recordings also allow
members who couldn't attend to catch up on discussions. **All team meetings must be recorded** using
the MS Teams recording feature. Recordings should be stored in an appropriately named folder within
the "Files" tab of the team's private channel, accessible to relevant team members, leadership, and
directors.
