  <summary>Which Thoth Tech repository should I clone to contribute to the Documentation Website?</summary>

To contribute to the Documentation Website, locate the

  <summary>When I attempt to run the documentation website locally, it says "The .nvmrc file is using

  <summary>How do I make a newly created folder appear on the side navbar of the Documentation website?</summary>

In the `astro.config.mjs` file, create a new label (if it’s a main folder) or item (if it’s a
subfolder). You do not need to reinvent the wheel; you can copy from what already exists in the
`astro.config.mjs` file, insert the copied block into the right location, and modify the labels and
directory link.

<details>
  <summary>
    I currently have a Pull Request that is still under review. When I make a commit for a new
    change, I am unable to create another Pull Request. Why is that?
  </summary>
  Because your Pull Request is still under review and you are pushing changes from the same GitHub
  account (which is your personal one), your new commit will still fall under your old PR. No cause
  for alarm—if all checks in your PR have passed, reach out to your approver to approve it so you
  can create a new PR for new commits.
