## Associated Risks

Remote working often involves using personal devices and home networks, which can introduce various
cyber risks. Understanding these risks is the first step towards mitigating them.

### Reduced Cyber Security Protections

Office environments typically have robust security measures such as antivirus software, intrusion
detection systems, and file encryption. In contrast, remote setups may lack these protections unless
individually implemented. This disparity can increase vulnerability to cyber threats.

### Accessing Insecure Networks

Unlike office networks, which are secure and controlled, remote workers often connect through home
or public Wi-Fi networks. These networks may have minimal security, especially free public Wi-Fi,
increasing the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.

### Shared Computers

Using a shared computer for work poses risks such as unauthorised access to data, accidental file
deletion, or malicious tampering. This risk is heightened if multiple users share the same account
on a single device.

### Reduced Cyber Security Resilience

Remote work environments can reduce vigilance against cyber threats. Without the immediate oversight
of an office setting, individuals might be less cautious, making them more susceptible to attacks.
Additionally, remote workers might lack clear escalation procedures in the event of a security
incident.

## Mitigation Strategies

Implementing effective practices can significantly reduce cyber risks associated with remote
working. Here are key strategies:

- **Regular Data Backups:** Regularly back up your data to restore it in case of a security incident
  or data breach.

- **Up-to-Date Antivirus Software:** Install and maintain active antivirus software to protect
  against various cyber threats. Some antivirus programs also offer file encryption.

- **Automatic Software Updates:** Ensure that all software and device firmware are kept up-to-date
  to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.

- **Strong Password Practices:** Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts, including cloud
  services and third-party applications. Consider using a password manager.

- **Secure Internet Connections:** Avoid using public or unsecured networks. Always connect through
  a secure, private network.

- **Sign Out of Shared Devices:** Always log out of your accounts on shared devices to prevent
  unauthorised access or data manipulation.

- **Cyber Security Awareness:** Continuously educate yourself about cyber threats and security
  practices through reputable sources and training resources.

These practices not only protect company data but also safeguard your personal information from
cyber threats.

## Useful Cyber Security Resources

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides valuable resources to enhance your cyber
security knowledge and readiness. Visit the [ACSC website](https://www.cyber.gov.au/) for
comprehensive information on cyber threats and protective measures. Key resources include:

- **Learning Resources:** Explore the [ACSC learning resources](https://www.cyber.gov.au/learn) to
  improve your cyber awareness and learn about effective protection strategies.

- **Phishing Quiz:** Test your ability to identify phishing emails with the
  [ACSC phishing quiz](https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/spotting-scams#sts--container),
  which offers insights into recognising scams.

- **Cyber Security Reports:** Review the
  [ACSC Cyber Security Reports](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics)
  for an overview of Australia's cyber threat landscape and annual security insights.

By staying informed and proactive, Thoth Tech members can effectively manage remote work risks and
maintain a secure working environment.
