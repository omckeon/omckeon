## Formatting

### Headings

Headings should be clear and concise, with all content relating to the heading or linking to
relevant information. Avoid using question formats for article headings. Use `h1` (#) for main
headings.

#### Example

> **Creating a New Project**

---

### Subheadings

Subheadings highlight specific sections and should not exceed three hierarchical layers. Use `h2`
(##) or `h3` (###) depending on the level.

#### Example

> **Setting Up Your Environment**

---

### Notes

Use notes for supplementary information necessary for understanding but outside the main content
scope. Keep them brief and to the point, with optional links for further reading.

#### Example

> **Note:** Remember to save your work frequently to avoid data loss.

---

### Hyperlinks

Use hyperlinks to connect readers to additional relevant information when content is beyond the
scope of the current article. For example:

#### Example

> One reference for Australian spelling is the
> [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).

---

### Lists

Begin lists with a colon (:) and follow specific punctuation rules based on whether items are full
sentences or fragments.

#### Example

> Essential features include:
>
> - Flexibility
> - Reliability
> - User-friendliness

#### Unordered/Bullet List

Use unordered lists for items without a specific order. Begin with a dash (-) and avoid punctuation
unless the items are full sentences.

#### Example

> - Flexible
> - Reliable
> - User-friendly

#### Ordered/Numbered List

Use ordered lists for steps or items that follow a specific sequence. Number each item and ensure
proper punctuation for complete sentences.

#### Example

> 1. Open the application.
> 2. Select 'File' from the menu.
> 3. Click 'Save As'.

---

### Text Formatting

- _Italics_: Titles, legislation, or user input.
- **Bold**: Emphasis.
- **_Bold and Italics_**: Combined emphasis.

#### Example

> This feature is **essential** for a positive _SplashKit_ user experience.

---

### Numbers

- Write out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
- Use commas for clarity in large numbers (e.g., 25,000).

#### Example

> The system processes three datasets daily and can handle up to 15,000 requests per second.

---

### Sentences

Keep sentences concise, with an average length of 15-20 words, and a maximum of 25 words. Avoid
redundancy and ensure clarity.

#### Example (too long)

> The application, which was developed over a period of three years by a team of skilled developers
> and designers, incorporates a wide range of features that are intended to enhance user experience
> and improve overall functionality, making it one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly tools
> available on the market today.

**Explanation:** This sentence is too long, making it difficult to follow.

#### Revised Example

> The application was developed over three years by a skilled team. It includes features to enhance
> user experience and improve functionality, making it one of the most comprehensive and
> user-friendly tools available.

---

## Writing

### Acronyms

Spell out terms on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Use the acronym alone
thereafter.

#### Example

> This is the Quality Assurance (QA) process. For all QA-related tasks, refer to the following
> guidelines.

---

### Capitalisation

Use capital letters for proper nouns. Follow sentence case for all writing, including headings.

#### Example

> The team will visit Melbourne next month.

---

### Verbs

Write verbs in the present tense and maintain consistency throughout.

#### Example

> The system processes data efficiently.

---

### Active Voice

Prefer active voice for clarity and simplicity. Use passive voice only when necessary, such as for
feedback or preserving relationships.

#### Example (Active)

> The developer fixed the bug.

#### Example (Passive)

> The bug was fixed by the developer.

---

### Avoid Nominalisation

Avoid converting verbs into nouns, as this can make writing cumbersome.

#### Example

> Instead of "The implementation of the feature was successful," use "The team successfully
> implemented the feature."

---

| Quotation Marks  | ""     | Enclose spoken words                                 |

### Avoid Using Contractions

Write out full words to maintain a formal tone. Avoid contractions to ensure clarity.

#### Example

> **Incorrect:** The user's guide can't be accessed online. **Correct:** The user's guide cannot be
> accessed online.

---

### Tone

Use a conversational tone, be brief, and direct. Avoid unnecessary words and contractions. Use the
Oxford comma.

#### Example

> You can find the instructions in the user manual.

---

### Voice

Use the second person (e.g., "You go to the library").

#### Example

> You should update the software regularly.

---

## Types of Writing

### Technical Content

Technical content should include a table of contents, revision date, and version ID. Tailor it to
the reader's skill level, and define technical terms clearly.

#### Example

> **Revision Date:** July 2024  
> **Version ID:** 1.0.0

---

### Code Examples

Provide clear and concise examples for key development tasks. Ensure code is easy to replicate and
follows best practices.

#### Example

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
